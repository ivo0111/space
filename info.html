      <h2>What is an exoplanet?</h2>
      <p>
        An exoplanet is a planet located beyond our solar system. They generally
        orbit around another star, but there are also some that float freely in
        space, known as rogue planets. More than 5,600 exoplanets have been
        confirmed out of the billions that exist.
      </p>
      <h2>Most well-known methods for discovering exoplanets</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Astrometry:</b> The orbit of a planet can cause a star to move
          slightly in relation to nearby stars in the sky, and the observation
          of this effect is known as astrometry. Scientists must take a series
          of images of a star and some of the other stars nearby in the sky. In
          each image, they compare the distances between these reference stars
          and the target star. Astrometry requires extremely precise optics and
          is particularly challenging to perform from the Earth's surface
          because our atmosphere distorts and refracts light.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Transit:</b> When a planet passes directly between a star and an
          observer's line of sight, it blocks a small portion of the star's
          light, thereby reducing its apparent brightness. Sensitive instruments
          can detect this periodic drop in brightness. From the period and depth
          of the transits, the orbit and size of the companion planets can be
          calculated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Imaging:</b> Taking actual photographs of exoplanets is extremely
          difficult due to how much brighter a star is compared to its planet.
          However, specialized optics and clever observation methods have made
          it possible to obtain a handful of images of exoplanets, and there is
          potential for many more to be captured in the future. One method of
          obtaining direct images, coronagraphy, uses a special masking device
          to block the light from a star so that the orbiting planets can be
          seen more clearly. A similar method involves deploying a giant
          starshade to block the glare of a star, precisely positioned in space
          between a nearby telescope and a star that hosts an exoplanetary
          system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Microlensing:</b> When a planet passes in front of a star along our
          line of sight, the planet's gravity acts like a lens. This focuses
          light rays and causes a strong temporary increase in brightness and a
          change in the apparent position of the star. Astronomers can use the
          gravitational microlensing effect to find objects that do not emit
          light or are otherwise undetectable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Radial velocity:</b> The radial velocity method measures slight
          changes in a star's speed as the star and planet move around their
          common center of mass. Astronomers can detect these variations by
          analyzing the spectrum of the star's light. In an effect known as the
          Doppler shift, the light waves from a star moving toward us shift
          toward the blue end of the spectrum. If the star is moving away, the
          light waves shift toward the red end of the spectrum. This occurs
          because the waves are compressed when the star approaches the observer
          and expand when the star moves away.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Types of stars:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Type G:</b> These are yellow dwarfs, meaning stars with medium
          temperatures and brightness intensity. They possess spectral lines
          indicating the presence of hydrogen and helium primarily. An example
          of a G-type star is our Sun.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Type M:</b> These are red dwarfs, meaning they are more common,
          smaller, and cooler stars, with low luminosity and a long lifespan. An
          example is Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Type K:</b> These are orange dwarfs, meaning they are brighter than
          red dwarfs but less bright than yellow ones. They have lifespans of
          billions of years, longer than G-type stars, due to their lower
          hydrogen fusion rate. Some examples are Alpha Centauri B and Arcturus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Type F:</b> These are white stars, meaning they are remnants of
          stars that have exhausted their fuel. They are dense and shine from
          residual heat, which is why their luminosity can vary. They have
          spectral lines that demonstrate the presence of hydrogen and helium,
          as well as other elements like calcium and metals. Compared to other
          stars, they have a short lifespan, of 2 to 4 billion years. In this
          group are stars like Procyon A and Alpha Aurigae (Capella A).
